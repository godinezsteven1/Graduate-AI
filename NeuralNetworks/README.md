# Neural Networks

This section of the repository contains my implementation for the **Programming Assignment 3:Neural Networks** project, where I designed and trained neural networks to classify **Fashion-MNIST** dataset images.

**Project Status:** üü° *Ongoing* ‚Äì Documentation and visualizations in progress

---

## Overview

In this project, I implemented two types of neural networks to classify Fashion-MNIST images:

- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN):**  
  A fully connected architecture that takes flattened 28√ó28 grayscale images as input.

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**  
  An architecture with convolutional layers optimized for image recognition tasks.

Both networks were tasked with classifying Fashion-MNIST images into **10 clothing categories**.

## Key Implementations

### Feedforward Network (`ffn.py`)
- Multiple fully-connected layers with optimized neuron counts
- **ReLU** activation functions
- **Dropout** for regularization 
- Accepts flattened image inputs (784 features)

### Convolutional Network (`cnn.py`)
- Multiple convolutional layers using **kernel**
- **MaxPooling** for spatial downsampling
- **ReLU** activations between layers
- Fully connected layers following conv operations
- **Dropout** for preventing overfitting

## üîç Additional Visualizations (Work in Progress)
-  **Kernel visualization** to understand learned features
-  **Feature maps** showing how the CNN processes images
-  **Training loss graphs** for convergence tracking
-  **Correct vs. incorrect classifications** with example visualizations

## Tools and Technology 
- **PyTorch** for deep learning model construction
- **Convolutional Neural Networks** for spatial feature extraction
- **MaxPooling** for downsampling and noise reduction
- **Dropout** for regularization
- **ReLU activation** for non-linearity
- **Cross-entropy loss** for multi-class classification
